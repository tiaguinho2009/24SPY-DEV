# [24SPY](https://tiaguinho2009.github.io/24SPY/)

**24SPY** is a developing platform designed to display real-time information about aircraft and ATC controllers currently online on the ATC24 server, similar to VATSIM Radar. This project serves both as a functional tool and a way to enhance my JavaScript, HTML, and CSS skills while contributing to the virtual aviation community.
